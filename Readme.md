# How to run the code 

1. Prepare the virtual environment

### For Mac or Unix based system: 

```bash 
# make sure the virtual environment is installed in the system
python3 -m venv venv

# activate the virtual environment

# initialize the virtual env
python -m venv venv   

# activate the virtual environment if you are using the powershell
venv\Scripts\activate   
```

2. Clone the code & Install the Requirements & dependencies

```bash

# get into working directory

git clone https://github.com/abhigyan-709/home-work.git

# get into the main directory and make sure you have activated the virtual env according to the system
# install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
